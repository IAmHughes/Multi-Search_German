# Multi-Search for language learning
Simple webpage that allows you to search for a word in your target language and find images, definitions, conjugation tables, and more for use in flash card systems (Anki, etc.) and general language learning.

## Getting started
Navigate to [the search page](https://iamhughes.github.io/Multi-Search_Language-Learning/) and select your language. Type your word into the search field and press `Enter` or click the `Submit` button. You can select and deselect which websites you wish to search in.

- _Note:_ The first time you use this search, you will need to disable any pop-up blocker on this page. The pop-up blocker blocks the multiple tabs from being opened

## Supported languages
Currently, the following are listed as options to choose to include in your multi-search:
- [German](https://iamhughes.github.io/Multi-Search_Language-Learning/html/german.html)
